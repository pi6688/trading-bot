Pivot points are price levels calculated using the high, low, and close of the last trading session. These price levels are potential areas of price exhaustion.

These are the formula for the common pivot points:

    Pivot Point (PP) = (High + Low + Close)/3
    1st Support Level (S1) = (PP x 2) – High
    2nd Support Level (S2) = PP – (High – Low)
    1st Resistance Level (R1) = (PP x 2) – Low
    2nd Resistance Level (R2) = PP + (High – Low)

## Long Trading Strategy

1. Doji at a support level
2. Buy on close of high close doji

## Short Trading Strategy

1. Doji at a resistance level
2. Sell on close of low close doji
